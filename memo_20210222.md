# SNET-Cardano brainstorm Feb 22, 2021

Participants:

SNET: Ben, Kabir, Ibby

IOHK: Dor, Aparna, Francisco

Takeaways:
* Cardano Catalyst is an evolving platform building itself while experimenting and learning from the iterative rounds of Catalyst Funds;
* Nevertheless, there's a specified (while not finally established -- which is by design) process, community contribution guidelines, contributor roles and reward schemes;
* In 2021, Catalyst processes one funding round (FundX) every 6 weeks. Currently Catalyst is closing the Fund3 (total value .5 million USD in ADA) and doing the ideation phase for the Fund4 (1 million). Fund5 will be 1.5 million USD. This includes also amounts for remunerating community contributors. The long term plan is to have funds with the value of $50 million each...
* The six-week round has roughly these stages each lasting about a week (as per the current scheme -- no guarantee that it will be the same, because it is constantly evolving):
	* ideation -- proposers can submit ides and get feedback;
	* proposal submission;
	* refine/finalize -- community gives feedback on proposals and proposers refine / resubmit;
	* assess -- proposals are assessed and commented on by community reviewers;
	* assess QA -- review of assesments by veteran (read trusted) community members;
	* governance phase -- voters discuss pose questions and vote
* Also there is pretty well established technical infrastructure for supporting the process: 
	* ideascale portal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/) making the whole process and steps completely transparent for the community;
	* discord / telegram, etc channels for specific community management and support;
	* weekly town hall meetings and updates hosted by Catalyst project manager Dor Garbash for information and community engagement, often inviting key IOHK / Cardano people, incl. Charles Hoskinson;
	* community voting and authentication system (via Cardano wallets)
* Each Fund is broken into number of challenges with predetermined amounts of funding in each;
	* Fund3 had 3 challenges Developer Ecosystem, DApp creation and Community Choice (identifying and describing challenges for Fund5);
	* Fund4 includes 7 challenges -- Developer Ecosystem, Dapps and Integrations, Distributed Decision making, Proposer Outreach, Catalyst Value Onboarding, Local Community Centers and Fund6 Challenge setting (again, for identifying challenges for Fund6 by the community)
	* Each challenge is described including its goals, requirements for proposers and evaluation criteria;
* There is a certain follow up process (mostly in the building, since there is a limited bandwith for that) which monitors and helps projects in their process; Projects are not time-constrained by Catalyst -- proposers are free to commit to their own development schedules (long or short term) 
* The main takeaway and idea is that SNET would join the process by introducing its own challenges backed by AGI-ADA funding amounts and specific SNET community which, at least initially, would be processed within the process and infrastructure briefly explained above. All changes and adjustments will be discussed and implemented with the help of Cardano / Catalyst via the established communication channel;
* Another takeaway is that the best is to start small and then increase the amount of funding and number of challenges quickly as the community gets progressively (better) on-boarded and engaged into the process.
* With this we hope to achieve network effects and a cross-pollination between Cardano and SNET communities, since proposers, community members and valuators will engage into the same process.
* SNET with AGI-ADA will be the first Cardano Native Asset to onboard Catalyst process, therefore there will be a valuable learning and sharing for Catalyst on that level (since it will probably will not be the last);

Preliminary action points / considerations:
* As soon as we have understanding of the schedule of AGI-ADA mining rounds we will have to propose and formulate initial challenges. An advice would be to have one or two at most challenges, possibly one open-ended and another more concrete;
* Walk through the stages of the process with the help of Catalyst and prepare reasonably for each of them, including the technical aspects of voting, staging, and per-project locking the DEEP utilization token pools of AGI-ADA. Many of these things (as well as the birth of AGI-ADA itself) depends on Cardano Goguen release, which is scheduled for March 2021.
* The work with SNET community for the purpose of funnelling the community energy towards work required for the DEEP Funding program's success in the short and long term;
* DEEP Funding token pool and the programme has an important role in supporting SNET Phase Two development roadmap as well as the community driven and open-ended SNET ecosystem expansion now and in the future. This needs a very well oiled and streamlined interaction of large number of developers working in a decentralized way on a portfolio of underlying technologies (SNET, Cardano, etc.) when the underlying technologies are themselves undergo fast and fluid development cycles. I am concerned about funnelling community energy and supporting / guiding the developer community towards achieving tangible results. This will also require certain (increasing) amount of developer relations between community developers and core development team of SNET. This aspect may need certain amount of auditing / preparation which seems to me important do in preparation for the DEEP Funding launch.
